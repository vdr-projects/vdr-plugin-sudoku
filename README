Requirements:
-------------

- VDR >= 1.3.47


Description:
------------

'Sudoku' is a VDR plug-in to generate and solve Number Place puzzles, so called
Sudokus.

A Sudoku puzzle consists of 9 x 9 cells subdivided into 9 regions with 3 x 3
cells. The rules are simple. There have to be the numbers from 1 to 9 in every
row, column and region. In the beginning some numbers are given. These cells are
painted with cyan background color. The aim of the puzzle is to find the missing
numbers. There is only one solution of a Sudoku puzzle.

The Sudoku puzzles are generated on-the-fly. The number of givens can be set in
the plug-in's setup page down to a minimum of 26 givens. The generation of
puzzles with less than 26 givens takes too long. By default the cells with
givens are symmetrically ordered. But this can be disabled in the setup.

To solve difficult Sudoku puzzles some hints can be used. Incorrect cells are
red and cells with ambiguous numbers are magenta. These hints can be disabled in
the setup. With the green key a cell can be marked. A marked cell has green
background color. With the yellow key the cursor is moved to the next free cell
with minimal possible numbers. The red key set the next possible number for the
current cell.

Each time the plug-in is started from the main menu the same puzzle is shown. A
new puzzle is only generated on VDR startup or if it has been requested by
selecting this command in the commands menu, which is opened with the blue key.


Setup:
------

- Givens count            Givens count of the generated puzzles (26-81).
                          Default is 36.
- Symmetric givens        Cells with givens are symmetrically ordered (yes/no).
                          Default is yes.
- Mark errors             Incorrect cells are marked with red color (yes/no).
                          Default is yes.
- Mark ambiguous numbers  Cells with ambiguous numbers are marked with magenta
                          color (yes/no).
                          Default is yes.
- Show possible numbers as pattern
                          Show a pattern in all empty cells representing the
                          possible numbers. The pattern is structured by a small
                          3 x 3 grid featuring the numbers from 1 to 9 from top
                          left to bottom right. If a number is possible in this
                          cell the background of the corresponding grid section
                          is colored.
                          Default is yes.
- Show possible numbers as digits (VDR >= 1.5.4)
                          Show digits in all empty cells representing the possible
                          numbers (yes/no).
                          Default is yes.
- Clear marks on reset    Unmark all cells when the puzzle is reset (yes/no).
                          Default is no.
